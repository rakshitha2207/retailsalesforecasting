[![Made with Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python%203.9.0-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

# Project Overview  
The **Retail Sales Forecasting and Monitoring** project is designed to provide real-time analysis and forecasting for the retail sales sector in the US market. This project offers valuable insights into sales performance across various retail categories, both durable and non-durable goods, allowing businesses to make data-driven decisions based on consumer spending patterns and industry health.

# Motivation  
Retail sales represent the total revenue generated by retail establishments across different categories in the US, offering a comprehensive overview of consumer spending habits. Monitoring and forecasting these sales are essential for:  
- **Business Performance Assessment**: Identifying trends and optimizing strategies.  
- **Inventory Management**: Adjusting stock based on demand predictions.  
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlining resource allocation and improving decision-making.

**Forecasting Models** empower stakeholders—retailers, manufacturers, and policymakers—to anticipate future sales trends, allowing them to:  
- Plan inventory effectively.  
- Allocate resources wisely.  
- Tailor marketing strategies to future consumer demand.

# Data Collection & Model Development  

The dataset for this project was sourced from the [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) platform](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RSXFSN), covering **January 1992 to September 2024**. Forecasting extends from **November 2024 to September 2025**.  

Given the dataset’s trend and seasonal characteristics, several forecasting models were explored:  

## Models Considered  
1. **Linear Regression with Seasonal Dummies**: Captures seasonal effects through dummy variables in a linear regression framework.  
2. **Holt-Winters Model**: Uses exponential smoothing to capture level, trend, and seasonality.  
3. **Decomposition Forecasting (Linear Regression & Seasonal Naïve)**: Separates trend, seasonality, and residuals, using:  
   - **Linear Regression** for trend.  
   - **Seasonal Naïve** for seasonality (assumes future sales mirror previous year’s season).  
4. **SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: Captures seasonality, trend, and noise in time-series data.

## Model Selection  
The **Holt-Winters Model** was chosen for its:  
- High accuracy and reliable confidence intervals.  
- Adherence to statistical assumptions.  
- Interpretability for non-technical stakeholders.  
- Development efficiency.

Including confidence intervals ensures reliable, actionable insights for effective planning and strategic decision-making.

# Features  
- **Confidence Intervals**: Indicate prediction reliability and uncertainty, aiding proactive decision-making.  
- **Automated Updates**: Real-time data retrieval from FRED API for continuous monitoring.  
- **Performance Tracking**: Evaluates model accuracy with metrics like **MAPE**, **RMSE**, and **MAE**.
